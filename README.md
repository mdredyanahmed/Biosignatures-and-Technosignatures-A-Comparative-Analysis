# Biosignatures-and-Technosignatures-A-Comparative-Analysis

I worked in this research project:Biosignatures and Technosignatures- A Comparative Analysis under supervision of Dr.Anamaria Berea.A biosignature is any substance – such as an element, isotope, or molecule – or phenomenon that provides scientific evidence of past or present life.Technosignature is any measurable property or effect that provides scientific evidence of past or present technology.


I tried to analyse it theoretically and computationally(via atmos packages in python and via data from Nasa Exoplanet Modeling and Analysis Center and Frontier Development Labs ).

The codes and data used for this project are contained in this respiratory .

I learnt to work regarding those codes from the following respiratories:

2.https://github.com/PyAtmos
